      "content": "Based on the search, there are no specific CPT codes directly labeled as \"partial parotidectomy.\" However, we can determine an appropriate code by breaking down the procedure and considering related codes.\n\nA partial parotidectomy typically involves removing a portion of the parotid gland. This could be due to various reasons such as benign tumors, infections, or cancer. The exact CPT code will depend on the nature of the tissue removed and any additional procedures performed.\n\n### Recommended Codes:\n\n1. **32500 (Parotidectomy, total)**: If a significant portion of the parotid gland is removed, this could be applicable. However, since it's a partial procedure, we need to consider more specific codes.\n   \n2. **32640 (Excision of benign tumor or cyst of salivary gland; with removal of involved tissue)**: If the parotidectomy involves removing a benign tumor or cyst and some surrounding tissue, this code could be used.\n\n3. **32650 (Excision of malignant neoplasm of salivary gland; with removal of involved tissue)**: If the procedure is for a malignant tumor, this code would apply.\n\n4. **32710 (Parotid duct exploration and/or repair)**: This could be relevant if there are complications involving the parotid duct during the surgery.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n- **32500 (Parotidectomy, total)**: This is a broad code that covers the removal of the entire gland. Since it's a partial procedure, we would need to use additional codes or modifiers.\n  \n- **32640/32650**: These codes are more specific and can be used if the parotidectomy involves removing a benign tumor or malignant neoplasm respectively.\n\n### Example Scenario:\nIf during a parotidectomy, only a small portion of the gland is removed due to a benign cyst, you might use **32640**. If there are complications such as removal of tissue from other areas (like the facial nerve), additional codes or modifiers may be necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor a partial parotidectomy, consider using **32640 (Excision of benign tumor or cyst of salivary gland; with removal of involved tissue)** if it involves removing a benign lesion. If there are complications or other tissues removed, you might need to use additional codes or modifiers.\n\nAlways consult the latest CPT book or coding guidelines for specific scenarios and ensure that all relevant procedures are coded accurately.",
