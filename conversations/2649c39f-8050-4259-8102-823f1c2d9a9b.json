The extracapsular dissection specifically means that the surgery involves removing tissue outside the capsule of the parotid gland, typically aimed at excising tumors or other pathological tissues while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.\n\n**No specific CPT codes found in our database for this query.**\nPlease try rephrasing with more specific ENT procedure terminology.\n\n**Coding Guidance:**\n- Select the code that most accurately describes the specific procedure performed\n- Check if any modifiers apply (e.g., -50 for bilateral procedures)\n- Ensure documentation in the medical record supports the selected code\n\n*All CPT codes provided are directly verified from our CPT code database.*",
