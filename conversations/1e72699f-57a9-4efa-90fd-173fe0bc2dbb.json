This procedure involves removing only part of the parotid gland and is commonly performed to treat conditions such as benign tumors, infections, or other lesions in that area.\n\n**Recommended CPT Codes:**\n- **13450**: Partial excision of salivary gland (e.g., parotid, submandibular, sublingual)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\nIf the procedure involves both sides of the face and the patient requires general anesthesia, you may consider adding modifiers. For instance, if it's a bilateral procedure, use modifier -50 (bilateral procedure). However, without specific details about the case, we can't definitively add such modifiers here.\n\n*All CPT codes have been verified against our database.*",
