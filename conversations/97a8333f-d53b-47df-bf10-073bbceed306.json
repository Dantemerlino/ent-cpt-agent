      "content": "When coding for a partial parotidectomy, you need to consider whether the procedure involves dissection of the facial nerve or not. Here are the most relevant CPT codes:\n\n### OPTION 1: CPT 42415 (Excision of parotid tumor or parotid gland; lateral lobe, with dissection and preservation of facial nerve)\n- **Description**: This code is used when a partial excision of the parotid gland involves dissecting around the facial nerve to preserve it.\n- **Applicability**: Use this code if the procedure specifically includes careful dissection around the facial nerve to ensure its integrity and function are maintained.\n\n### OPTION 2: CPT 42410 (Excision of parotid tumor or parotid gland; lateral lobe, without nerve dissection)\n- **Description**: This code is used when a partial excision of the parotid gland does not involve detailed dissection around the facial nerve.\n- **Applicability**: Use this code if the procedure involves removing part of the parotid gland but does not require meticulous dissection to preserve the facial nerve.\n\n### OPTION 3: CPT 42420 (Excision of parotid tumor or parotid gland; total, with dissection and preservation of facial nerve)\n- **Description**: This code is typically used for a complete excision of the parotid gland. However, if the partial excision involves extensive work around the facial nerve, this might be considered as an alternative.\n- **Applicability**: Use this code cautiously; it's more appropriate when the procedure approaches a total removal with detailed dissection to preserve the facial nerve.\n\n### Summary\nFor a partial parotidectomy:\n1. If the procedure includes careful dissection around the facial nerve, use **CPT 42415**.\n2. If no detailed dissection is performed and only part of the gland is removed, use **CPT 42410**.\n\nThese codes cover the most common scenarios for partial parotidectomy procedures.",
