The extracapsular dissection refers to the surgical technique where tissue is removed outside the capsule of the parotid gland, aiming to preserve healthy tissue while excising diseased areas.\n\n**No specific CPT codes found in our database for this query.**\nPlease try rephrasing with more specific ENT procedure terminology.\n\n**Coding Guidance:**\n- Select the code that most accurately describes the specific procedure performed\n- Check if any modifiers apply (e.g., -50 for bilateral procedures)\n- Ensure documentation in the medical record supports the selected code\n\n*All CPT codes provided are directly verified from our CPT code database.*",
