      "content": "It appears that there is no specific CPT code for a partial parotidectomy. However, we can approach this by breaking down the procedure into components and selecting appropriate codes based on the nature of the surgery.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Components:**\n   - The removal of part of the parotid gland.\n   - Any associated procedures such as facial nerve monitoring or lymph node biopsy.\n\n2. **Select Appropriate CPT Codes:**\n\n#### 1. Parotid Gland Removal:\nFor a partial parotidectomy, you would typically use codes that describe the excision of a portion of an organ (in this case, the parotid gland).\n\n- **CPT Code:** 32500 - Excision of salivary gland(s) [including facial nerve monitoring if performed]\n  \n  This code can be used to cover the removal of part or all of the parotid gland. If only a portion is removed, you might specify this in the procedure notes.\n\n#### 2. Facial Nerve Monitoring:\nIf facial nerve monitoring was performed during the surgery, it would be coded separately:\n\n- **CPT Code:** 68905 - Electromyography (EMG) of single peripheral nerve or muscle; with evoked response testing\n\n3. **Lymph Node Biopsy:**\nIf a lymph node biopsy was also performed as part of the procedure, you might use:\n\n- **CPT Code:** 14200 - Aspiration and/or biopsy of lymph node(s)\n\n### Example Coding Scenario:\nLet's assume the patient underwent a partial parotidectomy with facial nerve monitoring.\n\n- **Primary Code:** 32500 (Excision of salivary gland [including facial nerve monitoring])\n  \n  This code covers both the removal of part of the parotid gland and any necessary facial nerve monitoring during the procedure.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Modifiers:** If the procedure was bilateral, you would use modifier -50 to indicate that each side was separately performed.\n- **Documentation:** Ensure detailed documentation in the medical record about the extent of the parotidectomy (e.g., right superficial lobe only) and any additional procedures.\n\n### Summary:\nWhile there isn't a specific CPT code for \"partial parotidectomy,\" you can use 32500 to cover this procedure, which includes the removal of part of the parotid gland. If facial nerve monitoring or lymph node biopsy was performed, those would be coded separately using 68905 and 14200 respectively.\n\nThis approach ensures that all components of the surgery are accurately documented and billed.",
