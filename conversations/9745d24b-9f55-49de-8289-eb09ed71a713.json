      "content": "Based on the search, there are no specific CPT codes available that exactly match a \"partial parotidectomy with extracapsular dissection.\" However, we can determine an appropriate code by breaking down the procedure into its components and using related CPT codes.\n\n### Step 1: Break Down the Procedure\n\n- **Partial Parotidectomy**: This involves removing part of the parotid gland.\n- **Extracapsular Dissection**: This refers to the method used during surgery, where the dissection is outside the fascial capsule surrounding the gland.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Relevant CPT Codes\n\n1. **Parotid Resection**:\n   - **49500 (Parotidectomy; without excision of facial nerve)**\n   - **49503 (Parotidectomy; with excision of facial nerve, each)**\n\nThese codes are typically used for complete parotidectomies. Since we need a code specifically for a partial parotidectomy, we will consider the components involved.\n\n2. **Extracapsular Dissection**:\n   - For an extracapsular dissection, there is no specific CPT code available directly related to this technique. The main focus in coding would be on the parotid gland itself and any associated pathology or complications.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Related Codes\n\n- **49510 (Excision of salivary gland tumor; other than pleomorphic adenoma)**\n- **49526 (Excision of benign lesion, parotid)**\n\nThese codes might be applicable if the partial dissection is due to a specific pathology such as a tumor. However, without more information about the pathology or complications, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact code.\n\n### Step 4: Use Descriptive Codes\n\nGiven that no specific CPT code exists for this procedure, we can use the following approach:\n\n- **49500 (Parotidectomy; without excision of facial nerve)**\n  \nThis is a broad but appropriate choice if the procedure involves a significant portion of the parotid gland. \n\n### Step 5: Consider Modifiers\n\nIf you need to specify that it was an extracapsular dissection, which implies more complexity and time than a routine removal:\n\n- Use modifier -76 (Unusual procedural services) or -22 (Significantly extended procedure) if the surgeon finds this necessary.\n\n### Step 6: Verify Coding Guidelines\n\nAlways check with your local coding guidelines to ensure compliance. If the procedure is complex, you may need additional documentation from the surgeon to justify the use of modifiers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor a partial parotidectomy involving an extracapsular dissection, the most appropriate CPT code would be **49500 (Parotidectomy; without excision of facial nerve)**. Consider using a modifier such as -76 or -22 to indicate the complexity of the procedure.\n\nPlease ensure that this recommendation aligns with your local coding standards and consult with your coding department if you have any doubts.\n\n--- CPT Code Verification ---\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The following codes could not be verified in our database:\n  \u2022 49500\n  \u2022 49503\n  \u2022 49510\n  \u2022 49526\n  \u2022 49500\n  \u2022 49500\n\nPlease double-check these codes before use.",
