The extracapsular dissection specifically means that the procedure involves removing tissue outside the capsule of the parotid gland, typically aimed at excising a tumor or lesion while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.\n\n**No specific CPT codes found in our database for this query.**\nPlease try rephrasing with more specific ENT procedure terminology.\n\n**Coding Guidance:**\n- Select the code that most accurately describes the specific procedure performed\n- Check if any modifiers apply (e.g., -50 for bilateral procedures)\n- Ensure documentation in the medical record supports the selected code\n\n*All CPT codes provided are directly verified from our CPT code database.*",
