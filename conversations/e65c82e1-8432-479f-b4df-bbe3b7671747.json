      "content": "For a full Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS), there are several relevant CPT codes that can be used depending on the specific procedures involved. Since FESS is typically a comprehensive procedure, it often includes multiple steps such as polypectomy, antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and maxillary sinus surgery. Here are some appropriate codes along with explanations:\n\n### OPTION 1: CPT 34970\n**Description:** Endoscopic sinus surgery (eg, functional endoscopic sinus surgery [FESS], polypectomy, antrostomy, ethmoidectomy), bilateral, including culture and/or biopsy.\n- **Appropriate Use**: This code is most commonly used for a full FESS procedure that involves multiple aspects of the sinuses on both sides. It includes the removal of diseased tissue (polyps) and surgical intervention in various sinus areas such as the maxillary, ethmoid, and frontal sinuses.\n\n### OPTION 2: CPT 34971\n**Description:** Endoscopic sinus surgery (eg, functional endoscopic sinus surgery [FESS], polypectomy, antrostomy, ethmoidectomy), unilateral.\n- **Appropriate Use**: This code is less likely to be used for a full FESS because it typically refers to procedures on one side only. However, if the procedure was limited primarily to one side (which is rare in full FESS), this could apply.\n\n### OPTION 3: CPT 34972\n**Description:** Endoscopic sinus surgery, additional work beyond that required for code 34970.\n- **Appropriate Use**: If there are extensive steps or additional procedures performed during the FESS (such as revision surgeries, removal of large polyps, or complex surgical interventions), this code can be used in addition to CPT 34970. It is often reported when the complexity and extent of the surgery go beyond what is typically included in a standard bilateral FESS.\n\n### OPTION 4: CPT 34981\n**Description:** Endoscopic sinus surgery, with maxillary antrostomy (including culture and/or biopsy).\n- **Appropriate Use**: This code can be used if the procedure specifically includes extensive work on the maxillary sinuses. However, it is usually included within a more comprehensive CPT 34970 when performing full FESS.\n\n### OPTION 5: CPT 34982\n**Description:** Endoscopic sinus surgery, with frontal recess and ethmoid bulla antrostomy (including culture and/or biopsy).\n- **Appropriate Use**: This code is applicable if the procedure includes extensive work on the frontal sinuses and ethmoid areas. Similar to CPT 34981, it can be used in conjunction with CPT 34970 for a full FESS.\n\n### Summary\nThe most appropriate primary code for a full FESS would typically be **CPT 34970** as it covers the comprehensive nature of bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery. If additional procedures beyond those covered by CPT 34970 were performed, consider using **CPT 34972** to report the extra work involved.\n\nThese codes should cover a wide range of scenarios for full FESS and ensure appropriate reimbursement based on the complexity and extent of the procedure.",

Here are the top options:\n\n### OPTION 1: CPT 31395 (Pharyngolaryngectomy with radical neck dissection; with reconstruction)\n- **CPT Code:** 31395\n- **Description:** Pharyngolaryngectomy, with radical neck dissection; with reconstruction\n- **Standard Charge:** $22,252.00\n\n**Applicability:**\nThis procedure involves a highly complex surgical intervention that includes both pharyngolaryngectomy and radical neck dissection with reconstruction. It is typically used in cases of severe head and neck cancer where extensive surgery is required to remove the tumor and reconstruct the area post-surgery.\n\n### OPTION 2: CPT 31390 (Pharyngolaryngectomy with radical neck dissection; without reconstruction)\n- **CPT Code:** 31390\n- **Description:** Pharyngolaryngectomy, with radical neck dissection; without reconstruction\n- **Standard Charge:** $15,259.00\n\n**Applicability:**\nThis code is also for a major head and neck surgery but does not include the additional complexity of post-operative reconstruction. It would be used in cases where the patient's condition allows for surgical intervention without the need for extensive reconstructive work.\n\n### OPTION 3: CPT 69717 (Revision or replacement, osseointegrated implant; with percutaneous attachment)\n- **CPT Code:** 69717\n- **Description:** Revision or replacement (including removal of existing device), osseointegrated implant, skull; with percutaneous attachment to external speech processor\n- **Standard Charge:** $6,528.00\n\n**Applicability:**\nThis procedure involves the revision and replacement of an osseointegrated implant in the skull, typically for patients who have a cochlear or other auditory implants that need updating or maintenance due to complications or technological advancements.\n\n### Summary\nThe highest billing amount is associated with CPT 31395, which includes both pharyngolaryngectomy and radical neck dissection with reconstruction. This code would be the most appropriate if the surgical intervention requires extensive work involving these complex procedures. If less extensive surgery is required but still significant, CPT 31390 could be considered. For revision or replacement of auditory implants, CPT 69717 would be the highest billing option among those that involve implant-related surgeries.\n\nGiven the context and complexity, **CPT 31395** (Pharyngolaryngectomy with radical neck dissection; with reconstruction) is recommended as it provides the highest billing amount while being appropriate for a major surgical intervention.",
